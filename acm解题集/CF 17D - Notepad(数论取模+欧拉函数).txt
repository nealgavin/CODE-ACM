Description
Nick is attracted by everything unconventional. He doesn't like decimal number system any more, and he decided to study other number systems. A number system with base b caught his attention. Before he starts studying it, he wants to write in his notepad all the numbers of length n without leading zeros in this number system. Each page in Nick's notepad has enough space for c numbers exactly. Nick writes every suitable number only once, starting with the first clean page and leaving no clean spaces. Nick never writes number 0 as he has unpleasant memories about zero divide.
Would you help Nick find out how many numbers will be written on the last page.
Input
<p< p="">
The only input line contains three space-separated integers b, n and c (2?≤?b?<?10106, 1?≤?n?<?10106, 1?≤?c?≤?109). You may consider that Nick has infinite patience, endless amount of paper and representations of digits as characters. The numbers doesn't contain leading zeros.
Output
<p< p="">
In the only line output the amount of numbers written on the same page as the last number.
Sample Input
Input
2 3 3
Output
1
Input
2 3 4
Output
4
Hint
<p< p="">
In both samples there are exactly 4 numbers of length 3 in binary number system. In the first sample Nick writes 3 numbers on the first page and 1 on the second page. In the second sample all the 4 numbers can be written on the first page.
