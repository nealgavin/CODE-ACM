Description
Mirko works on a pig farm that consists of M locked pig-houses and Mirko can't unlock any pighouse because he doesn't have the keys. Customers come to the farm one after another. Each of them has keys to some pig-houses and wants to buy a certain number of pigs. 
All data concerning customers planning to visit the farm on that particular day are available to Mirko early in the morning so that he can make a sales-plan in order to maximize the number of pigs sold. 
More precisely, the procedure is as following: the customer arrives, opens all pig-houses to which he has the key, Mirko sells a certain number of pigs from all the unlocked pig-houses to him, and, if Mirko wants, he can redistribute the remaining pigs across the unlocked pig-houses. 
An unlimited number of pigs can be placed in every pig-house. 
Write a program that will find the maximum number of pigs that he can sell on that day.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers M and N, 1 <= M <= 1000, 1 <= N <= 100, number of pighouses and number of customers. Pig houses are numbered from 1 to M and customers are numbered from 1 to N. 
The next line contains M integeres, for each pig-house initial number of pigs. The number of pigs in each pig-house is greater or equal to 0 and less or equal to 1000. 
The next N lines contains records about the customers in the following form ( record about the i-th customer is written in the (i+2)-th line): 
A K1 K2 ... KA B It means that this customer has key to the pig-houses marked with the numbers K1, K2, ..., KA (sorted nondecreasingly ) and that he wants to buy B pigs. Numbers A and B can be equal to 0.
Output
The first and only line of the output should contain the number of sold pigs.

思路：建图，0和n＋1分别为源点和汇点，以顾客为点，当顾客有k的钥匙，而且是第一个访问，就建条从源点到K的容量为k猪圈的猪数目，否则就建条从k到上个人访问的标号的流为无穷的的边。在建每个顾客到汇点的边等于其需求数。然后最大费用用流就是答案。
本题，刚开始练，就用最基础的ford 增广路径算法。

#include<iostream>
#include<cstring>
using namespace std;
const int oo=1e9;
const int mm=1005;
const int nn=105;
int s,t;
int cus[nn][nn],flow[nn][nn];
int pig[mm],pre[nn],last[mm];
int q[mm];
int n,m,a,b,c;
void ford()
{
  memset(flow,0,sizeof(flow));
  int mflow[nn];
  mflow[0]=oo;
  int qs,qt,u,v;
  while(1)
